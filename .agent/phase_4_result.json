  "notes": "Implemented full Phase 4 polish: 3D progress ring (ProgressRing class) with torus geometry at (0,5.5,0), DrawRange arc fill proportional to completion ratio, blue-to-gold color interpolation, GSAP pulse on task complete/uncomplete, animated deflation on completed-task delete, victory detection at 100% completion with particle cascade and ring shatter sequence. IU-4A (getCompletionRatio) was already implemented in Phase 3. Fixed THREE.Color.lerpColors unavailability by using the copy().lerp() fallback. 67 tests pass (53 store + 14 new progress-ring tests), npm run build exits 0."
