  "notes": "T120: Shared RoundedBoxGeometry/EdgesGeometry across all task cards reduces draw calls; thickness reduced 1.5→0.5 for Safari compatibility. T121: gsap.killTweensOf() added before delete animation to prevent stale tween access; registry delete confirmed before reposition. T122: Manual chunk splitting (three/gsap/postprocessing) added to vite.config.js; total gzip ~181KB (target <600KB). T123: Safari fix via thickness reduction (included in T120). T124: a11y-announcer live region, ARIA labels on form inputs, aria-pressed on filter buttons, .sr-only CSS utility, focus returns to add-task-btn on form close, store event announcements wired in main.js. All 67 tests pass; build exits 0."
